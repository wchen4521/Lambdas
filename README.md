****Description****
 * The LambdaExample class is a Java program demonstrating the use of Lambda expressions for
various calculations on a list of numbers. It includes functionality to find the minimum, maximum,
average, and median values.

****Design Choices****
1. List of Numbers:
Utilizes the List interface to store a collection of Double values.
2. Lambda Expressions:
Implements Lambda expressions for finding the minimum and maximum values in the list.
3. Average Calculation:
Includes a method to calculate the average value of the list.
4. Lambda Block for Median Calculation:
Uses a Lambda block to calculate the median value of the sorted list.
5. Functional Interfaces:
Defines functional interfaces (ValueFinder and MedianFinder) to encapsulate Lambda
expressions and blocks.

****Main Method****
1. Initializes the program by providing a list of numbers and invoking Lambda expressions and
blocks for calculations.
2. Displays the results for the minimum, maximum, average, and median values.
